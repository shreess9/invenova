# Raspberry Pi Port - Instructions

You have successfully deployed the code to `forge-integrated`.

## Step 1: Switch Workspace
1. In your editor/IDE, **Open Folder** `forge-integrated`.
2. This is crucial so the AI can see the new files.

## Step 2: Initialize
The AI in the new workspace will help you:
1. Create a new `venv`.
2. Install the lightweight dependencies.
3. Configure `Piper TTS` (you may need to download the windows binary manually, the AI will guide you).

## Step 3: Simulation
Run `mini_assistant.py` in the new folder. It should be much faster but sound slightly less human.

## Step 4: Porting
Once simulation works, you will simply copy this entire `forge-integrated` folder to your Raspberry Pi and run it there!
